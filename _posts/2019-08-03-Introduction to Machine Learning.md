#### What is Machine Learning?
-------------------

> “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”

This is how [Tom Mitchelle](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/) defines Machine Learning. It is essentially art and science of designing adaptive algorithms. In other words, Designing algorithms that ingest data and learn a (hypothesized) model of the data. This model can then be used to detect patterns, predict future data points, help in decision making, etc.
